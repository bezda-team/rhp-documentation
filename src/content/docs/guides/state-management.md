title: State Management
description: An explainer on how components manage state and a guide to working with component state variables

Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

Example Code block

```python
import streamlit
import io

# This is a comment in python

def add_two_integers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_two_integers(2, 1)

```
