import { AnimatedDots } from '@bezda/rhp-core';

## Add the package to your project

To get started with using **rhp** in your project, run the command:

```bash
npm i isomorphic-dompurify @legendapp/state@^1.11.1 @bezda/rhp-core
```

The command above installs [**isomorphic-dompurify**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-dompurify), 
 [**@legendapp/state**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@legendapp/state) (version 1.11.1), 
and [**@bezda/rhp-core**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bezda/rhp-core).  
:::caution
It is recommended to use **rhp-core** version 0.0.20 or higher. 
The following test example will not work with earlier versions.
:::
:::note
We are currently working on migrating to **Legend-State 2.0**. Until then, it is recommended to use  
`@legendapp/state@1.x.x` versions.

## Try it out
After installing **rhp**, you can do a quick test to see if everything has installed correctly by importing 
the `AnimatedDots` component and placing it in your React app component tree.

For example, you can place it in the `main.tsx` file of a Vite react-ts project 
(or in `index.tsx` for a CRA project):

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { AnimatedDots } from '@bezda/rhp-core';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
);
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <AnimatedDots />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
When you start the app, you should see something similar to the following:
<div className=" 3xs:scale-[0.35] 3xs:my-[-10.5rem!important] 3xs:mx-[-16.5rem!important] 2xs:scale-[0.43] 2xs:my-[-9rem!important] 2xs:mx-[-14.5rem!important] xs:scale-[0.5] xs:my-[-8rem!important] xs:mx-[-13rem!important] sm:scale-[0.7] sm:my-[-4.5rem!important] sm:mx-[-8rem!important] 2col:scale-[0.65] 2col:my-[-5.5rem!important] 2col:mx-[-9rem!important] mdlg:scale-[0.8] mdlg:my-[-3.5rem!important] mdlg:mx-[-7rem!important] ">
  <AnimatedDots widthPreset={1} animationDelay={3000} className="animated-dots" scale={0.9} client:only />
</div>
:::note
React takes components and renders them into the DOM. **rhp** components in particular also contain 
inner html elements and CSS. As such, any pre-existing page styling and layout may impact the appearance 
of the html that is produced. This also means that you can tweak/style/configure your plots to better fit 
with the rest of the page/site/app.
